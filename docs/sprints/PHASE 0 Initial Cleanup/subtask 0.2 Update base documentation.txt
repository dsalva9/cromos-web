## üì¶ Subtask 0.2: Update base documentation

### Prompt for Claude CLI:
```
I need to update documentation to reflect that the official collections system was removed.

CONTEXT:
- Just removed ~7 tables from the old system
- New system not yet built
- Documentation should reflect clean state

TASK:
Update the following files:

1. docs/database-schema.md
   - REMOVE complete sections:
     * "## Core Tables" (collections, stickers, etc.)
     * "## Album Pages System"
     * RPCs for collections/stickers
   - KEEP:
     * profiles (intact)
     * Trading tables (trade_proposals, trade_chats, trades_history)
     * Notifications
   - ADD note at the beginning:
```
     # Database Schema - v1.6.0-alpha (Post-Cleanup)
     
     **Current state:** Official collections system removed.
     Marketplace + templates system under construction.
     
     See CHANGELOG.md for pivot details.
```

2. docs/current-features.md
   - REMOVE official collections features
   - KEEP:
     * Auth system
     * Trading proposals
     * Chat system
     * Notifications
     * Admin backoffice
   - MARK as "‚ö†Ô∏è UNDER RECONSTRUCTION":
     * Collection management
     * Trading discovery

3. CHANGELOG.md
   - ADD new entry:
```
     ## [1.6.0-alpha] - 2025-XX-XX - PIVOT: Marketplace + Templates
     
     ### üîÑ Breaking Changes
     
     **Official Collections System REMOVED**
     - Removed 7 tables: collections, stickers, collection_teams, etc.
     - Removed 7 RPCs: find_mutual_traders, search_stickers, etc.
     - Reason: Pivot to neutral marketplace model + community templates
     - No affected users (pre-production)
     
     **Next steps:**
     - Sprint 1: Marketplace tables + RPCs
     - Sprint 2: Templates system
     - Sprint 3-5: Integration + Social + Admin
```

4. TODO.md
   - UPDATE with simplified structure:
```
     # TODO - CambioCromos v1.6.0
     
     ## ‚úÖ Completed - Cleanup
     - [x] Remove official collections system
     - [x] Update base documentation
     
     ## üöß In Progress - Sprint 1: Marketplace MVP
     - [ ] Create trade_listings table
     - [ ] Marketplace RPCs
     - [ ] Marketplace frontend
     
     [... rest of sprints ...]
```

FORMAT:
- Keep professional but direct tone
- Don't mention "deprecated" (it was removed, not deprecated)
- Focus on future, not past

DELIVERABLES:
1. 4 updated files: database-schema.md, current-features.md, CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md
2. Clear current state structure
3. Visible roadmap

Give me git commands to commit all together.
