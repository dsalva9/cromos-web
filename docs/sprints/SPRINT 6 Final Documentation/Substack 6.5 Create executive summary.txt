## 💡 Key Technical Decisions

### ✅ Decisions Made

1. **Pivot without user migration**
   - Reason: No users in production
   - Benefit: Clean slate, no tech debt
   - Savings: 2-3 weeks of complexity

2. **Reuse trading system**
   - Reason: Trade proposals is model-agnostic
   - Benefit: Chat, history, notifications work out-of-the-box
   - Savings: 3-4 weeks of development

3. **Community templates over official albums**
   - Reason: Legal risk + scalability
   - Benefit: UGC, no license dependencies
   - Trade-off: Variable quality (mitigated with ratings)

4. **Neutral hosting (LSSI/DSA)**
   - Reason: Legal compliance
   - Benefit: No liability for content authenticity
   - Requirement: Robust moderation system ✅

### ⏳ Pending Decisions (Post-MVP)

1. **Sales with money or only trades?**
   - Impact: v1.7+ features
   - Consideration: Monetization model, commissions

2. **Native mobile app or PWA?**
   - Impact: v1.8+ roadmap
   - Consideration: Budget, complexity

3. **Public API?**
   - Impact: Potential third-party ecosystem
   - Consideration: Rate limiting, monetization
