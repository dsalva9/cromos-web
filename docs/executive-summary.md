# Executive Summary - CambioCromos v1.6.0

## üéØ Project Overview

CambioCromos is a Spanish-language marketplace and community platform for sports cards, pivoting from a traditional sticker collection app to a neutral marketplace model with community-generated content.

### Business Problem

The original CambioCromos app faced several challenges:

- Legal compliance issues with official licensed content
- Scalability limitations with centralized content management
- Limited user control over collections and trading
- High licensing costs for official sports content

### Solution

A complete pivot to a neutral marketplace model that:

- Provides legal compliance through neutral hosting (LSSI/DSA)
- Enables community-generated content for unlimited scalability
- Offers users complete control over their collections
- Eliminates licensing costs for official content
